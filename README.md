# infojobs-backend-java
InfoJobs Java backend challenge.


## Objectives

In modern days, basic algorithms are usually not used as often as it should and programmers tend to rely on builtin `sort` methods. Understanding the fundamentals is crucial to build a great foundation.

This challenge proposes 4 common algorithms to sort arrays to be solved:
1. Bubble Sort: Implement the BubbleSort algorithm in the `BubbleSort.java` file.
2. Heap Sort: Implement the HeapSort algorithm in the `HeapSort.java` file.
3. Merge Sort: Implement the MergeSort algorithm in the `MergeSort.java` file.
4. Quick Sort: Implement the QuickSort algorithm in the `QuickSort.java` file.

*Attention*: There are function signatures already defined in each `.java` files. It is recommended to implement the defined functions.

### A bit of knowledge

> **Bubble Sort** is considered the simplest sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(N^2)

> **Heap Sort** is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heaps. It works by finding the minimum element and placing it at the beggining. Repeat the same process whilst pushing its value to the next minimum position.

> **Merge Sort** is a sorting algorithm. It works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together. It tends to be recursive.

> **Quick Sort** is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorith. It works by picking an element as a pivot, partion the given array around the pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
